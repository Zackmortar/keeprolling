#Keep Rolling - A Journey Into My Early Development Days

#Overview
Welcome to "Keep Rolling," a game I created during my early days of development when I was just 14 years old. While this game may not boast cutting-edge graphics or complex mechanics, it holds sentimental value for me as a testament to my journey in the world of programming. This repository stands as a time capsule, preserving the simplicity and passion that fueled my early projects.

The game was developed using Unity in C# and showcases some of the fundamental concepts I learned during my early coding endeavors.
